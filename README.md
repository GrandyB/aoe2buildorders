## Background

Build orders are hard and often very detailed; for the newer/low ELO player, hard to follow. I wanted to experiment with a simpler format.

## Adding new build orders

Visit the discussions page to provide one: https://github.com/GrandyB/aoe2buildorders/discussions/1
I'll try to keep up with these.

Alternatively, feel free to create a pull request. It's pretty easy to see how build orders are added into the index.html.
